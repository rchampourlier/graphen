# Graphen

Graphen is an ongoing project that aims at giving a shot
to a simple spec-management tool based on the concept of
simple cards with lots of links!

## Use Cases

### Agile Specifications

Use Graphen to create Features, Epics and User Stories entities.
Link Epics to Features, User Stories to Epics, but not just like
a tree! If you need a User Story to appear in multiple Epics, or
even in multiple Features, just do it! Graphen will then give
you a way to discover and navigate all these dependencies.

### Dependencies Identification

Let's say you have started an Agile Specification on Graphen,
and you now add some technical information, for example
Data Models and Data Attributes. Graphen will help you identify
every Features, Epics and User Stories involved by a change
in a given Data Attribute.

Imagine doing the same by adding a Page entity? A Resource one?
Possibilities are infinite!

Ongoing is the word...
